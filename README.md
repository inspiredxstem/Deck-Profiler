# Deck-Profiler

Deck Profiler allows the user to create a deck based on cards from a myriad of trading card games (e.g. Yugioh, Pokemon, Magic: The Gathering). At the moment, our scope is set to Yugioh for our MVP.
## API

Ilker and I are utilizing the Yu-Gi-Oh! API by YGOPRODeck (https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) 

## Iteration Methods

.forEach() and .filter() 

## Events

The addEventListener() funcitonality will be implemented into our project. We plan on listening to onclicks, submits, and hopefully hover events.

## Stretch Goals

1) Show all cards from a fuzzy search result
2) Allow the user to add 3 of the same card into their main deck
3) Show card's information and price when hovered
